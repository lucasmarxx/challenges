# challenges
Ahoy

this repository is where I put several challenges that I find in the internet.

I have created this repository as I want to show people my progress through Python. As I'm really a newbie in this language, I'll be starting by some really easy tasks!

Mainly getting those challenges from udemy courses, and the one I prefer is _'100 days of code: the complete python pro bootcamp 2022'_, from **AppBrewery**. 

Hope you enjoy, I'm a real enthusiast in **.py** and would like to learn as much as I can.
